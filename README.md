# Sport-Vs.-e-Sports-Viewers

Read me 

 We were tasked with telling a story with data visualizations, and focus on providing users an interactive way to explore data themselves. 

A 10 minute presentation that lays out the theme, coding approach, data wrangling techniques, and final visualization to be prepared.

The group had unlimited options to what the theme would be, but encourage to think broadly.

## Specific Requirements

 
## 1. Visualization must include a Python Flask powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 

## 2. The project should fall into one of the below four tracks:

○ A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly

○ A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data

○ A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)

## 3. Project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.

## 4. Project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

## 5. Project must include some level of user driven interaction, such as menus, dropdowns, and textboxes.

## 6. Final visualization should include at least three views

## TASKS

1. Decision to review two different data sets: The project team decided to review data from the NFL Data website and EA Sports gaming website.

2. Import Data: The team used an SQL database to import the data from the two websites.
 
3. App.py: The team used Python to process the imported data and perform any necessary cleaning or manipulation.
 
4. JS Library: The team used the Google Charts library to visualize the data in a user-friendly and informative way.
 
5. Flask API: The team used the Flask web framework to create an API that allows for the data to be accessed and displayed on a website.
 
6. Javascript: The team used JavaScript to create interactive features and dynamic elements on the website.

7. HTML: The team used HTML to create the structure and layout of the website.

8. Website: The final product is a website that displays the data from the NFL Data website and EA Sports gaming website in a visually appealing and informative way. The website allows users to explore the data and interact with it using various visualization tools.

Overall, this data flow showcases how the team used different technologies and programming languages to import, process, visualize, and display the data on a website. The website provides a clear and easy way to understand the data and make insights from it.
